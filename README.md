# Titanic Spaceship with Logistic Regression

This is a getting started project. 

This notebook features a typical data science process.

From data exploration to training a simple model, this notebook is for 'getting-started' purposes.

Some graphs generated; 
![Train features correlation](graphs/train_features_corr.png)
This graph shows correlations between numerical features in this dataset. No correlations are above 0.5, so it's safe to keep all features.

![Categorical features vs target](graphs/categorical_features_vs_target.png)
This graph informations about categorical features' contribution to the target feature.

![Predicted Transports](graphs/predicted_transports.png)
And this graph, shows how many passengers were predicted to be transported or not.
